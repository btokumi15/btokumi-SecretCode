attempt 1 - making a program that takes a string and takes the letters of the string and replaces them with the 13th letter from it. - this would be done by taking the letter and either assigning 16 individual int values to each letter, or creating a long list of if->then->replace _ with _ statements. if i choose to assign number values to each letter, i could create a variable and then have it add 13 to that number and then call the letter valued to that number. both the encoded and decoded classes in this project will utilize the scanner function for input of a sentence or an encoded message and will println the decoded or encoded phrase.}
